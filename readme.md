A line filter is a common type of program that reads input on stdin, processes it,
 and then prints some derived result to stdout. grep and sed are common line filters.

 Hereâ€™s an example line filter in Go that writes a capitalized version of all input text.
  You can use this pattern to write your own Go line filters.
